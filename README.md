# Moods App

# Objective

The objective of this app is to understand and implement the fundamentals of jetpack navigation through fragments and room databases, as well as to practice previous learned skills such as layouts and views all while making a functional mood recording diary app. The app allows the user to record an entry that specifies their current mood with prompts for reaction image selection (of the current mood), the title of the entry, and the description of the entry. The entry is then recorded to system storage. The user also has the option of creating more entries, viewing entries, editing entries, and deleting entries all spanning different fragments.
