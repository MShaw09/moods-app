# Objective

The objective of this assignment was to understand and implement the fundementals of jetpack navigation through fragments and room databases, as well as to practice previous learned skills such as layouts and views all whilst making a functional mood recording diary app. The app allows the user to record an entry that specifies their current mood with prompts for reaction image selection (of the current mood), the title of the entry, and the description of the entry. The entry is then recorded to system storage. The user also has the option of creating more entries, viewing entries, editing entries, and deleting entries all spanning different fragments.

# Demo

In the following video you can see how the application works and a comprehensive overview of the codebase
